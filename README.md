# react-portfolio (Frontend) 
This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).
The app is deployed at https://olees-portfolio.netlify.com.

Go to my youtube channel for some of the video tutorials that I recorded while building this project.
For example, the video below is explaining how environmental variables are stored and set in the local as well as in production.

The original website was built with JQuery and migrated to a React version. This web app has a backend in order to keep track of user data and inputs.


If you want to copy down the repo :
git clone https://github.com/olee2002/react-portfolio.git
npm install
npm start

The backend portion has to be downloaded separately which is hosted as a separate app.
git clone https://github.com/olee2002/portfolio-api.git
npm install
npm start or if nodemon installed nodemon
