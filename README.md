# react-portfolio (Frontend) 
This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).

The original website was built with JQuery and I have migrated it to a React version. This web app has a backend in order to keep track of user data and inputs. 

You can find the most recent react version of this app below. 
React|Node|Express|Postgresql - [here](https://olee-portfolio.herokuapp.com).
JQuery -[here](https://olees.netlify.com/).


If you want to copy down the repo :
git clone https://github.com/olee2002/react-portfolio.git
npm install
npm start

The backend portion has to be downloaded separately which is hosted as a separate app.
git clone https://github.com/olee2002/portfolio-api.git
npm install
npm start or if nodemon installed nodemon
